# Kubernetes: Microservices
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Kubernetes: Microservices`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

![Kubernetes: Microservices][lil-thumbnail-url] 

In this intermediate level course, technical curriculum developer Kim Schlesinger teaches you about Kubernetes networking and configuring service-to-service communication, which is critical for microservices in Kubernetes. Gain an understanding of the history of containers and Kubernetes. Find out how the platform was designed for microservices architectures. Get hands-on experience deploying three microservices to a cluster running locally, and then explore different ways of enabling service-to-service communication. Plus, explore advanced Kubernetes networking topics.

## Instructions

This repository does not have any branches. Download the entire repository and you get the exercise files in their final state.

Each folder corresponds with a movie with an exercise file. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.


## Installing

1. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD or PowerShell (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree. 
    - You can also download a ZIP file from Github and extract the contents to your machine.
1. Place the exercise files on your computer when you can easily access them. 
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
   - A code editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended)
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
